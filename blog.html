            The word technology comes from two Greek words, techne and logos.
            The word techne means art, skill, craft, or the way where logos
            means word, the utterance by which the inward thoughts are
            expresses, a real saying pr an expression. The particular word

            Technology may also make us have a thought about internet, data or
            other various advancements in the world of modern engineering. Many
            technologies from all around the globe have been adopted to aid
            human life, from the most simple inventions, to complex systems that
            function entirely independently from the very human experience.
            Without these all modern technologies human beings wouldn’t have
            been able to take civilization and modernization this far.

        We must always look at the both sides of the coin, getting to the point
        the widely familiar term “Technology” has it’s both positive and
        negative impacts on the human life and the whole world. Technology is
        inevitable and critical to our daily lives and play a vital role in our
        mental and physical existence in the world. The negative impacts of it
        on the physical health of people is most probably the easily calculable
        of all the negatives of the technology. Use of technology leads to
        metabolic diseases caused by sedentary lifestyles encouraged by
        technology use. Over use of technology may affect our mental health
        causing depression and anxiety. As cars and vehicles are the examples of
        modern technology, indeed it has made our daily lives easier with the
        transportation but the use of vehicles causes pollution which is a great
        threat to the nature itself. In conclusion, However, if we don’t keep up
        with new technology, we risk losing ground to our competition.

        Basically , bonsai plants are ordinary trees and shrubs which are
        dwarfed by a system of pruning roots and branches by tying with wire.
        This art was first originated in China , perhaps over 1000 years ago.
        Back then, people researched and trees were cultivated in trays ,
        earthenware pots and trained in realistic shapes. However, bonsai has
        been developed by the Japanese people from a long time. As all of us
        know that technology has evolved the world in a very drastic way.
        Technology has made our life very easier and it has simplified a lot of
        day to day things. We are well known about E-commerce and internet of
        things. In this era of modern technology , life has been very easier ,
        with the use of applied science and technology there is the facility of
        doing online business and getting engaged in E-commerce activitie.
        Getting back to the topic , Today people or business companies engaged
        in producing of “Bonsai plants” can freely and easily sell their
        products online through their E-commerce websites. From any part of the
        world the buying and selling of bonsai plants can be done. Before ,
        bonsai plants were available only in Japan and China and it was
        practically not possible for everyone to visit those particular
        countries to purchase Bonsai plants but now due to the advancement of
        technology it is possible to trade from each and every nook and corner
        of the world, So, thankfully technology has also played a vital role in
        selling of Bonsai plants
